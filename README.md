# pshscs3_1stproj.
If you are reading this, you are either a classmate, my subject teacher or lost.
This is my project for the first quarter of computer science 3. Its a student project if the quality didnt give it away.
Had to rush this in the dead of night, its built with ductape and bubblegum.
Try not to get sick.
