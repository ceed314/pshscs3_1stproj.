	   <p>Powerlines, theyre everywhere, Specially in suburbia. The trees of the concrete jungle with their wires as the branches and vines, the transformers hanging off them their fruit and the streetlights protruding from them their flowers.
	   Sometimes, they like to hum and sing songs that mesmerizes the mind. They provide us with resources much needed. They're probably the reason you're even able to access this in the first place.</p>
	
     
		 <h3> So, come and join me. Look in awe at their majesty and power (no pun intended) </h3>

	 <p>UPDATE >> My eyes hurt and its 21:55 in the deadest night. OUchers. The basic body of the site has been made(altho the extra fun parts are still missing) And now all i just need are images of powerlines</p>
	 
	 <small> Gold fish woman (scarlett eyler) is now the official placeholder image from now on</small>
	 
	 <p>UPDATE >> Fixed a few things up, these are not the last of these fixes. Also, found myself some poles (you should be seeing them in the gallery and the box to the right)</p>
